## üöÄ Upcoming Features (Help Welcomed!)

I'm also looking to improve Student Attendance Dashboard (S.A.D). Here are some ideas for future enhancements (contributions are welcome!):

The following features are planned, ordered by priority:

- **Implement Core Subject Card Functionality**:
  - [ ] **View Timetable Button**: Implement a modal to display the weekly class schedule for all subjects. Include an option for users to upload their timetable if not already available.
  - [ ] **Info Button**: Develop a feature to show detailed statistics, including classes per week, remaining classes in the semester, attendance history, and projected skip allowances with percentage changes after each skip.
  - [ ] **Edit Functionality**: Enable inline editing of attendance data (e.g., classes occurred, attended, skipped) directly on the subject card. Allow users to adjust the minimum required attendance percentage for each subject.

- [ ] **UI/UX Enhancements**: Improve the application's overall visual design and user experience.

- **Lower Priority plans**
  - [ ] **Data Export/Import**: Allow users to back up their data and restore it when needed.
  - [ ] **Notes Section**: Allow users to add and manage small notes related to each subject.
  - [ ] **Semester/Term Management**: Introduce functionality to group subjects by academic terms or semesters.
