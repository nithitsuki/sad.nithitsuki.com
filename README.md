## 🚀 Upcoming Features (Help Welcomed!)

I'm also looking to improve Student Attendance Dashboard (S.A.D). Here are some ideas for future enhancements (contributions are welcome!):

The following features are planned, ordered by priority:

- **Implement Core Functionality**:
  - [ ] **PWA Support**: I need an icon design (oT-T)尸 
  - [ ] **View Timetable Button**: check out [this issue](https://github.com/nithitsuki/sad.nithitsuki.com/issues/1)
  - [ ] **UI/UX Enhancements**: I'm a programmer, but no designer (╥_╥)

- **Lower Priority plans**
  - [ ] **Data Export/Import**: Allow users to back up their data and restore it when needed.
  - [ ] **Semester/Term Management**: Introduce functionality to group subjects by academic terms or semesters.
